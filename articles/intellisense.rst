IntelliSense
============
This feature is disabled by default, as it is still experimental.

By `Lex Li`_

The Snooty language server implements many useful features.

Autocompletion
--------------
After typing ``:doc:`/`` you can use `the default VSCode keyboard shortcut
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_rich-languages-editing>`_
``^Space`` to trigger suggestions on file paths.

Document links
--------------
Directives like ``image``, ``figure``, ``include``, and ``literalinclude`` now
displayed as file links. You can use those links to jump to the linked files.

Cross-referencing documents (aka ``doc`` role) are also transformed as links.

Breadcrumbs
-----------
The project/file structure is displayed as `Breadcrumbs
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_breadcrumbs>`_ .
